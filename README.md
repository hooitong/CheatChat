Milestone 1

Overview / Ideation
---------
**CheatChat** is an web application based on node.js aims to provide students situated at National Univeristy of Singapore to experience a new type of chat system based on each student's geographical location. This is to address the lack of anonymity factored by the dominance of SSO social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. We are aiming to achieve the level of *Gemini* during our course in CP3108B.
